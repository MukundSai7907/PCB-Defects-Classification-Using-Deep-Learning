# PCB-Defects-Detection-and-Classification

## This is an implementation of the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.08204.pdf

## Overview: 
The paper proposes a method to first detect PCB defects using template matching and then classify them using a Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNets) to classify the following defects into the following categories, 

1) Missing Hole
2) Mouse Bite
3) Open Circuit
4) Short
5) Spur
6) Spurious Copper
